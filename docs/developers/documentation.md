# Documentation

This is will show you how to edit our documentation and how to properly contribute while outlining some rules for us.

## Rules

::: warning
Please read the rules before you start editing the documentation.

- All new images will be in WEBP or JPEG format with maximum of 90% image quality
- Images will be of sensible resolution (no 4k or higher resolution images)

- Keep it simple

## How to edit

All documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs` folder. You can edit it directly on GitHub or you can clone the repository and edit it locally.

Edits on GitHub will create a Pull Request with the changes and they will be waiting for review.

Once the change is reviewed and approved it will be merged into the branch and will be deployed by our CI/CD pipeline.
